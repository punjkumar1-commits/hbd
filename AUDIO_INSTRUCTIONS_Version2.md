# Audio files for the site

This repository contains `index.html` which references two audio files expected at the repository root:

- `happy-birthday-voice.mp3` — a short spoken "Happy Birthday" voice clip
- `your-song.mp3` — a song to play after the voice clip

Please add these files to the repository root (same folder as `index.html`) or update the `src` paths inside `index.html` to point to their locations (for example `assets/your-song.mp3`).

Notes:
- Browsers allow audio playback when triggered by a user gesture (like the button click in the page).
- If you want sample placeholder MP3s, I can provide small base64-encoded placeholders or instructions to create tiny silent/tones for testing.
